(24, 63, 3, '3 \n \nINTRODUCTION  \nUrban Congestion is one of the problems that the world is facing right now \nespecially for daily commuters and riders. One of the nations most affected by this \nissue is the Philippines, where in 2023, commuters and drivers spend around 240 \nhours stalled on the road, with urban congestion accounting for nearly 170 of those \nhours (Inquirer, 2024). The Government also found ways to combat this issue by \ncreating the Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP) where it aims to \nreduce about 20% of vehicles however this doesn’t solve the issue where it only \nreduces by 4.3% (J. R. F. Regidor, 2018).  \n \nThe world finds solutions through the use of  technology that could enhance or \nmitigate the problems faced by the society. Intersections are one of the reasons for \nurban congestion which would be solved by traffic lights. However, 19% of urban traffic \nis caused by waiting at traffic signals ( Congestion Causes , n.d.). That is why it is \nimportant to use smart traffic lights since it significantly decreases delays and stops by \n20% to 30% (Wang et al., 2024).   \n \nThis paper focuses on building the VisLight, a vital system that enhances safety \nand convenience for both pedestrians and drivers. It assists citizens in safely crossing \nbusy streets by providing timely signals, while also optimizing traffic flow for vehic les, \nreducing congestion caused by poorly managed crosswalks and intersections. By \nadapting to real -time traffic conditions, this system minimizes delays and improves \noverall road safety, creating a smoother commuting experience for everyone involved. \nVisLight is an Intelligent Traffic Light Sensor which aims to mitigate Urban Congestion \nduring rush hours.  \n \n \n '),
(25, 63, 4, '4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  \nThe current traffic light system in most cities in the Philippines is neither \ninnovative nor designed to effectively address the traffic congestion that many people \nexperience. Pedestrians primarily rely on signal lights to determine their actions: the \nred light indicates they must stop, the yellow light signals that the red light is about to \nappear, and the green light indicates they can go. However, this system does not \naccount for the varying needs of pedestrians or drivers. An updated traffic \nmanagement  system is necessary to reduce delays and provide more responsive \nadjustments to better serve everyone on the road. What features can be added to a \nbasic traffic light system to help alleviate urban congestion?  \n \nPeople with limited awareness of road safety, particularly senior citizens and \nindividuals with disabilities, must be properly guided and supported. Crossing the road \nremains a challenge for these individuals, even with the construction of overpasses \nand p edestrian walkways. Pedestrian lanes should always be clearly marked, well -\nmaintained, and safe for use at all times to ensure the safety and accessibility of all \nroad users. How can a traffic light system be accessible and increase pedestrian \nsafety?  \n \nPersistent issues at intersections, delays in emergency vehicle access, \nextended wait times for pedestrians, and the frequent occurrence of accidents must \nbe addressed. These problems are common and largely a result of the limited \neffectiveness of current traffic light systems in ensuring safety and efficient traffic \nflow.  How can the enhanced traffic light sensors be managed to effectively \noptimize road efficiency for both pedestrians and drivers?  \n \nThe current traffic light system in many cities in the Philippines is outdated and \ninefficient, contributing to congestion, pedestrian safety concerns, and delays. The '),
(26, 63, 5, '5 \n \ndevelopment of a system like VisLight will effectively address these issues and provide \npractical solutions. Tackling these problems is crucial for improving both road safety \nand the well -being of citizens.  \n \nOBJECTIVE S OF THE STUDY  \nGenerally, the study aims to develop a system and an application that will \nprovide assistance to  users and reduce congestion in selected areas.   \n \nSpecifically, it aims to:  \na. Gather all essential information to optimize traffic flow; reduce congestion and \nvehicle wait times by dynamically modifying traffic light patterns based on real -\ntime data, resulting in smoother traffic flow across intersections.  \nb. Develop an effective and well -managed system that will address the utmost needs \nof road users during travel, prioritizing safety, convenience, and efficiency.  \nc. Provide enhancements to existing traffic light systems, aiming to improve road \nefficiency for both pedestrians and drivers by optimizing traffic flow, reducing \ncongestion, and increasing safety.  \n \nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  \nThis research intends to develop VisLight, a vital system that enhances safety \nand convenience for both pedestrians and drivers. The study is significant and will \nbenefit the following:  \n \nDrivers.  The development of a system that provides real -time information on \ntraffic flow and offers assistance will help drivers make informed decisions about their \nroutes, allowing them to determine whether they should continue their drive or take an \nalternative path. This will help reduce congestion, prevent traffic jams, and minimize \nthe chances of drivers being stuck on the road for hours.  '),
(27, 63, 6, '6 \n \nPedestrians.  The development of this system and application will significantly \nimprove pedestrian safety on the road. Pedestrians will be easily tracked and \nmonitored, receiving real -time guidance on whether it is safe to cross and when they \ncan proceed. Additionally,  the long -term effectiveness of the system will provide \nongoing support, ensuring that pedestrians can navigate the roads with confidence, \nfree from safety concerns.  \n \nFuture Researchers.  Future researchers will recognize the potential benefits \nof such a system for urban areas and may be inspired to adopt similar approaches, \ndeveloping even more advanced solutions. These researchers could build upon this \nstudy to further enhance its effect iveness, ultimately improving the daily commute for \ncitizens by reducing road -related issues and ensuring safer, more efficient travel for \nboth drivers and pedestrians.  \n \nIn summary, the significance of this study lies in its focus on citizens who drive \nand crossroads to reach their destinations. Additionally, researchers play a key role, \nas their work could lead to further improvements that have a lasting, positive impact \non all road users.  \n \nTIME AND PLACE OF THE STUDY  \nThe study was carried out at Cavite State University - Imus Campus, under the \nsupervision of Mr. Ricky Tepora, who holds the position of Instructor for the subject of \nSoftware Engineering II. The study, which takes place over the first semester of the \nacad emic year 2024 -2025, focuses on creating the VisLight system to reduce urban \ncongestion at the Emilio Aguinaldo Highway Intersection. To successfully accomplish \nits goals of enhancing traffic flow and lowering congestion in this crucial area, the \nresearch intends to improve the characteristics found in this study.  \n '),
(28, 63, 7, '7 \n \nSCOPE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY  \nThe scope of the VisLight system encompasses the integration of intelligent \nfeatures designed to optimize urban traffic management and enhance road safety. This \ninnovative solution aims to streamline traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve the \ncommuti ng experience for both drivers and pedestrians. By leveraging real -time data \nand adaptive technology, the system addresses the diverse needs of road users, \nfosters efficient traffic management, and promotes safer and more accessible \nintersections. VisLight  is focused on creating a well -managed, sustainable, and user -\ncentered approach to urban mobility, ensuring a smoother and safer journey for all.  \nDashboard Module. The Dashboard Module serves as the homepage for the \nVISLIGHT application, providing a comprehensive overview of relevant information for \nboth mobile and PC users. On the mobile application, the dashboard displays \nsuggested places based on the user\'s curren t location, real -time traffic and weather \ndata for the city, and a search function similar to Google Maps for finding specific \nlocations. On the PC application, the dashboard offers real -time traffic data displayed \nper city, the operation al status of traffic lights (indicating whether they are functioning \ncorrectly or experiencing issues), and the capability to modify traffic light timings and \nsequences. This centralized view ensures users have access to essential information \nand control f unctionalities depending on the platform they are using.  \nLogin Module. The Login Module prioritizes the security and authenticity of \nuser interactions, requiring valid login credentials, typically usernames and passwords. \nOn the VisLight mobile application, users can create accounts to gain access to the \napplication\'s feature s. Conversely, on the PC application, access to the VisLight admin \naccount is restricted to authorized personnel only, ensuring that sensitive \nadministrative functions are controlled and managed by designated individuals. This \ndistinction in access control reflects the different usage contexts and security \nrequirements of the mobile and PC platforms.  '),
(29, 63, 8, '8 \n \nMap Module. This module provides a real -time visual representation of the \nroad network and traffic conditions. It displays a dynamic map overlaid with traffic \ninformation, including vehicle density, traffic flow directions, and congestion hotspots. \nThe map module inte grates data from the sensor module to accurately reflect current \ntraffic conditions. It may also incorporate other data sources, such as GPS data from \nconnected vehicles or traffic cameras, to enhance its accuracy and \ncomprehensiveness. This mo dule is essential for visualizing the real -time traffic \nsituation.  \nStatus Module. This vital functionality is designed to monitor the health and \noperational status of all components within the VisLight system, including sensors, \ncommunication infrastructure, and software applications. It promptly provides alerts \nand notifications in the  event of malfunctions, errors, or connectivity issues, ensuring \nsystem reliability and efficiency. This module also tracks key performance indicators \nto evaluate the system\'s overall effectiveness, identifying areas for improvement and \nnece ssary modifications. In addition to maintaining the system\'s integrity, the Status \nModule keeps users informed about the application\'s status on their devices. It alerts \nusers if there are errors in delivering requested information, issues caused by low or  \nno internet connection, or if the phone\'s location cannot be determined. By ensuring \nsmooth operations and clear communication, the Status Module enhances both \nsystem reliability and user experience.  \nSensor Module. This serves as the cornerstone of the VisLight system\'s \nintelligent traffic management capabilities by collecting real -time traffic data from \nstrategically placed sensors at intersections. Leveraging advanced technologies such \nas inductive loops, video cam eras, and radar, this module detects critical parameters, \nincluding vehicle presence, speed, and volume. The collected data is transmitted to a \ncentral system for processing and analysis, forming the foundation for dynamic traffic \noptimizati on. By providing accurate and timely information, this module ensures the '),
(30, 63, 9, '9 \n \nsystem can respond effectively to changing traffic conditions, improving overall road \nefficiency and reducing congestion.  \nNotification Module. This functionality keeps  users informed about real -time \ntraffic conditions and help them make well -informed travel decisions. It notifies users \nabout the current state of the roads, including whether their area is experiencing \ncongestion, if a specific route is recommended for dr iving, or if the roads are deemed \nsafe for travel. It also provides insights into whether a particular day or time is optimal \nfor traveling, accommodating user preferences for timely and relevant updates. Short \nuser-friendly updates are sent each time a us er activates the application depending on \ntheir preferred settings. By delivering accurate and personalized notifications, this \nfeature ensures users can plan their journeys efficiently and with confidence.  \nEmergency Notification. Aligned with the Notification Module, this \nfunctionality enhances the application by providing timely alerts to users when an \naccident occurs nearby or within the Emilio Aguinaldo Highway. This feature ensures \nthat users are immediately informed of the sit uation through a prominent alert, \naccompanied by a \"Be safe, drive safely\" message displayed in all users\' applications. \nIn addition to accident notifications, this module includes the capability to suggest \nalternative routes to hel p users avoid affected areas, minimizing delays and ensuring \nsmoother travel. Furthermore, it provides real -time updates on the status of the \nincident, such as clearance progress or emergency response activities, allowing users \nto stay informed and adapt t heir plans accordingly. The capabilities of this feature \ncollectively promote safer and more efficient road usage.  \nControl Module. The main feature of VisLight is this module, which gives \nauthorized users the ability to manage traffic lights in the event of emergencies or \nunexpected malfunctions. It enables real -time adjustments to minimize interruptions, \nguaranteeing a more seamless traffic flow and cutting down on delays brought on by \ntechnical problems. The module\'s seamless integration with the optimization and \nmonitoring systems guarantees that all modifications are data -driven and sensitive to '),
(31, 63, 10, '10 \n \nthe traffic situation at hand. It enables operators to promptly handle unforeseen \nsituations, like accidents, road closures, or high -priority vehicles like fire trucks and \nambulances, by permitting instantaneous manual overrides. Additionally, the Control \nModule has an easy -to-use interface that streamlines intricate processes, lowering the \npossibility of human error and guaranteeing prompt and effective decision -making. It \nalso records every action taken, giving future analysis and accountability a record.  \nPedestrian Safety Module. This module serves as a dynamic guide to help \npeople cross crowded streets safely. It offers visual indicators and real -time signals to \nmake sure pedestrians know when it\'s safest to cross. In order to reduce dangers, \nintegrated sensors automatically modif y the crossing signals based on current \nconditions while monitoring traffic flow and pedestrian movement. In order to \naccommodate those with impairments or restricted movement, the module also \nincludes auditory cues and unambiguou s visual prompts, guaranteeing accessibility \nand inclusivity. Moreover, countdown timers and warnings let pedestrians know how \nlong it is left to cross, enabling them to make wise choices and cross intersections with \nassurance. The Pedestrian Safety Module  promotes pedestrian safety while ensuring \nefficient traffic movement by serving as an intelligent crossing guide.  \n \nThe study acknowledges certain limitations that may affect the system\'s \neffectiveness and adaptability. The VisLight system is specifically designed for urban \nenvironments in the Imus City and may not be seamlessly applicable to other cities \nwith different  traffic systems, policies, and infrastructures. Technological constraints \nare also essential to highlight, such as the reliance on internet connectivity for \ncommunication between servers, sensors, and traffic lights to enable real -time traffic \nmonitoring and management. Limited or unstable internet connectivity could hinder the \nsystem\'s ability to provide accurate and timely traffic updates, potentially increasing \ncongestion.  '),
(32, 63, 11, '11 \n \nThe system\'s software users are restricted to individuals with high knowledge \nof traffic flow and management to ensure proper maintenance and handling of sudden \nerrors in the traffic algorithm. This limitation minimizes the risk of misuse or \nmismanagement,  but it also excludes the possibility of broader user involvement. \nDriver and pedestrian guides regarding traffic conditions will be available exclusively \non the Android OS(Android 8.0 and up), while traffic monitoring and other related \ncontrols will be li mited to Windows OS (Windows 7 and up) devices  and only the admin \ncan access this feature. This separation of functionalities may pose accessibility \nchallenges for users who rely on a single platform.  \n \nAdditionally, failure to maintain real -time data awareness, whether due to \ndevice malfunction or system downtime, could worsen urban congestion rather than \nalleviate it. The system\'s success is also dependent on user adoption and proper \nimplementation, whi ch could face challenges such as resistance to new technology or \nlimited understanding of the system\'s operation.  \n \nLastly, external factors such as changes in urban infrastructure, government \npolicies, and unforeseen financial constraints may impact the system\'s implementation \nand long -term sustainability, which are beyond the scope of this study.  \n \nDEFINITION OF TERMS  \nAlgorithms.

(35, 63, 14, '14 \n \nREVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE  \nFOREIGN LITERATURE  \nIntelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)  \nRavish and Swamy (2021) in their study, indicated that roads could be safer \nand greener with enhanced efficiency through the application of emerging Intelligent \nTransportation Systems (ITS) technologies. Their paper conducts a literature survey \nto identify  the effectiveness of key existing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for \nmanaging traffic and examines their performance based on functional efficiencies. The \nfindings indicate that ITS options are diverse, involve a range of technologies, and \nhave the potential to address most traffic -related issues. However, the application of \nITS should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the location or area where traffic \nmanagement is needed. When the appropriate ITS is selected based on the nature of  \nthe location, travel time and congestion can be reduced, leading to improved safety \nand increased productivity.  \n \nArtificial Intelligence   \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by \ntechnology, particularly computers. Akhtar and Moridpour (2021) discussed the traffic \ncongestion prediction problem as something that can be defined through the \nestimation of  parameters related to traffic congestion into the short -term future. Akhtar \nand Moridpour (2021) highlighted in their study the capability of Artificial Intelligence to \nprovide necessary models that can be used to further mitigate urban congestion.  \n \nTraffic Light Synchronization  \nTomar et al. (2022) studied different traffic light control technologies and found \nthat traffic light synchronization techniques are capable of solving urban congestion. \nTraffic light synchronization is a method wherein a car moving at a certain speed down  \none side of the road may keep going to the other end of the road indefinitely by getting '),
(36, 63, 15, '15 \n \nas many green lights as possible at junctions (Tomar et al., 2022). The study enables \nadaptation of Traffic light synchronization for the desired Smart traffic light for it \ndiscusses the benefit, development, and application of the technique.   \n \nTraffic simulation  \nIn this study conducted by Dorokhin et al. (2020), motion modeling was used for \ntraffic studies, modeling, planning and development of transport networks and \nsystems. It represents the construction of a working model that reflects the similarity \nof propert ies or relations with the real problem under consideration. Modeling makes it \npossible to study the complex tasks of traffic not in real conditions, but in the laboratory. \nIn the three simulation models conducted in transport infrastructure, there is no id eal \nmodel to solve the whole complex of problems associated with traffic flows. Each \nsimulation model allows one to solve a certain range of transport problems, and \ntherefore the use of a particular model depends on the purpose of the study. Summing \nup the  analysis, it can be assumed that the selection of the right model in accordance \nwith the objectives of the study is an important step towards solving transport \nproblems.  \n \nArduino  \nArduino is an open -source physical computing platform that may be used to \ncreate interactive things that can be connected to the Internet or stand alone. Arduino \nwas first created for designers, artists, and other creatives who do not have to be \nelectrical  engineers to integrate physical computing into their work (Banzi & Shiloh, \n2022). Later on, it emerged as the preferred venue for literally millions of people looking \nto use digital technology for innovation. The Arduino project is a widely used \neducation al tool that was created in an educational setting. Teaching strategies, \ncurriculum, and other material are shared by the same open -source mindset that gave \nrise to the community that freely exchanges knowledge, solutions, and projects.  '),
(37, 63, 16, '16 \n \nGoogle Maps  \nGoogle Maps is a web -mapping service that is an invaluable tool for many \nusers for interactively navigating areas of the Earth especially in metropolitan areas. It \nregularly serves vast quantities of travel time queries from users and enterprises alike \n(Derrow-Pinion et al., 2021). Google Maps shall be utilized to track traffic flow by \nproviding real -time information about the current traffic situation in multiple areas. It \nwill provide visual input to the users and managers of the software application.  \n \nLOCAL LITERATURE  \nDriver Education  \nBugabuga and Puyo (2024) stated that by prioritizing quality education, \ncompetent instructors, hands -on experience, and the strategic use of technology, the \ncountry can lay the foundation for a more effective driver education system and safer \nroads. Howeve r, according to them, further research and the implementation of \nappropriate regulatory measures are essential in order for these efforts to help reduce \nroad accidents and foster responsible driving behaviors across the nation.  \n \nNaïve Bayes Algorithm  \nNaive Bayes comes from a family of algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It \nis widely utilized for its simplicity and efficiency in machine learning, and for \nclassification problems. Libnao et al. (2023) presents a Traffic Incident Prediction and \nClassificat ion System (TIPCS) that uses the Naïve Bayes Algorithm to proactively \nforecast and categorize traffic incidents, ultimately enhancing incident management \nand optimizing traffic flow. Libnao et al. (2023) suggests that with it, an incident can be \npredicted specifically on how it is likely to occur and and it would be classified \nappropriately. It was also mentioned that as it is trained on historical incident data, the \nsystem is continuously updated with new information, allowing its accuracy to improve \nover time.  '),
(38, 63, 17, '17 \n \nTraffic Congestion  \nThe study conducted by Aydinan (2020) aims to assess the main reasons or \npossible causes of traffic congestion in the city and to identify potential courses of \naction to alleviate congested traffic across Cabanatuan. Data analysis revealed that \npoor mainte nance is one of the four key reasons of traffic congestion, poor control \nmeasures come next, then physical inadequacy, and last human error. According to \nthe study, the most significant result of traffic congestion is vehicle interposition. One \nof the reco mmendations was that road users follow traffic laws and regulations, \nparticularly by keeping in their proper lane, avoiding counterflow, and invading in any \nway feasible when traffic congestion occurs. Moreno (2023) discussed the perspective \nof the daily c ommuter in Zamboanga City, showing that traffic congestion could lead \nto longer journey times, elevated stress levels, and decreased productivity. The article \nalso shed light to factors of traffic congestion which are inadequate road infrastructure, \nunregu lated street parking, and inefficient traffic flow management. The study \nrecommends improving road infrastructure, creating stricter parking regulations and \nimproving policies.   \n \nErgonomic Risk Factors of Traffic Enforcers  \nTraffic enforcers are one of the most dangerous occupations to have; they are \nprone to workplace accidents, injuries, and illnesses since they are frequently exposed \nto ergonomic risk factors while executing their duties. According to Gumasing et al. \n(2023 ), traffic enforcers are vulnerable in such settings since they are exposed to \nfluctuating environmental elements such as ambient temperature, air pollution, and UV \nradiation, all of which contribute to the development of various health diseases. The \nstudy  found that traffic enforcers in Manila City are more likely to suffer from \nmusculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to poor posture and exposure to environmental \nrisks like heat, noise, and air pollution. Therefore, it is advised to implement \nadministrative m easures, like job rotation or shifting, and regular rest periods in order '),
(39, 63, 18, '18 \n \nto reduce the risk of MSDs. Additionally, it emphasizes how smart traffic sensors can \nreduce the number of traffic enforcers who may be exposed to danger factors.  \n \n Internet of things (IoT)  \nThe Internet of Things, or IoT, is a network of sensors and software designed \nto communicate and share information via the internet (Paradina & Noroña, 2021).  \nThe Internet of things (Iot) is always described as linked to gadgets and smart devices. \nHowever , this past few years, it expands to smart cities where traffic patterns and \nsensors are now connected to each other. This enables traffic lights to be connected \nto each other using Internet of things (IoT) plus studies show that it can also use \nagricultur e for part tracking of the plants. Also, for real -time monitoring of the traffic \nwhich could help researchers to analyze the traffic patterns and mitigate the traffic \ncongestion in urban areas.  \n \nREVIEW OF RELATED STUDIES  \nFOREIGN STUDIES  \nAutomated Real -Time Intelligent Traffic Control System for Smart Cities Using \nWireless Sensor Networks  \nHilmani  et al. (2020) presented an intelligent and connected system based on \nthe deployment and implementation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) at road \nintersections and also in car parks in order to make roads and cities smarter. This \nsystem was put together t hrough the combined use of several innovative IoT \ntechnologies, such as WSN, RFID, and mobile application. As per Hilmani et al. (2020), \nthis system is diﬀerent from existing systems, due to the fact that it regroups two \nintelligent systems namely the traﬃ c light control system and the intelligent parking \nsystem.  \n '),

(2024) highlight that effective traffic management systems can \nalleviate congestion, reduce emissions, and enhance safety for all road users. They \npropose that incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) into traffic control systems \ncould impro ve their flexibility and responsiveness to fluctuating traffic conditions, \noffering a powerful solution to the challenges faced by contemporary urban areas. This \npaper adds to the expanding body of knowledge on AI -driven traffic management, \nproviding valua ble insights into the practical application of LLMs in urban settings.  \n \nTraffic light optimization with low penetration rate vehicle trajectory data  \nWang et al. (2024) enable to create a traffic light optimization recognized as an \neconomical technique for lowering energy use and traffic in cities without affecting the \nphysical infrastructure for roads. Using vehicle trajectory data, the researcher foun d a \nre-timing system could be done without the use of any sensor or detector.   The study \nproclaimed that it can be used at any fixed -time signalized intersection worldwide \n(Wang et al., 2024).  \n \nSensors in Traffic Management System  \nOne effective way to lessen traffic congestion is to integrate sensors into traffic \nlight systems, a practice that has been extensively researched. The Smart Traffic \nManagement System (STMS) aims to improve accessibility to emergency services, \nreduce traff ic, and minimize wait times in order to revolutionize urban mobility (Jangeed \net al., 2024). Innovative solutions are more important than ever as cities throughout \nthe world struggle with growing issues including transportation congestion, safety risks, \nand environmental degradation. To capture vital traffic data including vehicle counts \nand speeds, the STLCS strategically deploys sensors at crucial locations utilizing a \nvariety of technologies, including infrared, radar -based, and inductive loop sensors.

However, given that they will be traversing numerous traffic lights \nand heavy traffic in the future, are their replies as prompt as we anticipated? This issue \nwas resolved by a system developed by Almuraykhi and Akhlaq (2019); it connects \nmicro -controlled traffic lights, Google maps, an Android app, the MQTT (Message \nQueuing Telemet ry Transport) protocol, and the Internet. Google Maps determines the \nshortest route to the destination and the locations of all traffic signals along the route, \nand the Android app lets the user choose the destination. The mobile app also provides \nthe arri val time for each traffic signal controller. When the car eventually reaches the \ntraffic lights, it will discover that they are open and do not interfere with the other \nsignals. Following a number of tests and assessments, it was determined that the \nsystem  is 100% dependable and performs exceptionally well.  \n \nLOCAL STUDIES  \nEffective Utilization of Traffic Lights in Common Congested Areas in Urban \nSettings through Crowdsourcing   \nVillaluz (2023) addressed the objectives of minimizing traffic congestion in \nurban areas, by coming up with the idea of producing an adaptive traffic light \nscheduling system, developing a mobile application for user engagement, and creating \nan Arduino -comp atible microcontroller simulation for traffic lights. Villaluz (2023) \nbelieves that adopting innovative approaches and leveraging technology, will result in \nthe creation of a smarter and more efficient transportation infrastructure.  \n \n '),

Addressing this issue requires \ninnovative and effective traffic management strategies that can adapt to ever -changing \ntraffic patte rns. Different studies collectively highlight a clear shift towards dynamic, \nadaptive systems capable of responding in real -time to fluctuating traffic conditions, \nmarking a significant advancement in urban mobility. It explores diverse approaches \nto intel ligent traffic management, ranging from sensor -based systems to advanced \nartificial intelligence applications. This evolution promises to optimize traffic flow, \nreduce emissions, and enhance overall safety for all road users.  \n \nEarly advancements in intelligent traffic management focused on integrating \nsensor networks into existing traffic infrastructure. Hilmani et al. (2020) proposed an \nintelligent and connected system utilizing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, \nand mobile  applications to create a combined traffic light control and intelligent parking \nsystem. This integrated approach aimed to optimize both traffic flow at intersections \nand parking availability within urban areas. This interconnectedness of traffic \nmanagemen t components represented a significant step towards more holistic urban \nplanning. Similarly, Jangeed et al. (2024) emphasized the crucial role of various \nsensors —including infrared, radar -based, and inductive loops —in capturing essential \ntraffic data, such  as vehicle counts and speeds. This data collection enabled more '),
(47, 63, 26, '26 \n \nresponsive and data -driven traffic light control within a Smart Traffic Management \nSystem (STMS).  \n \nFurther research explored the potential of optimizing existing infrastructure \nwithout requiring extensive and costly physical modifications. Wang et al. (2024) \ndemonstrated that effective traffic light optimization could be achieved using readily \navailable  vehicle trajectory data. This approach enabled a re -timing system for traffic \nsignals without the need for deploying additional sensors or detectors. This method \noffered a significantly more cost -effective solution for improving traffic flow at existing \nsignalized intersections worldwide. Furthermore, Villaluz (2023) focused on developing \nan adaptive traffic light scheduling system, coupled with a user -friendly mobile \napplication for crowdsourced data and an Arduino -compatible microcontroller \nsimulation. T his approach emphasized the importance of user interaction and the use \nof accessible, open -source technology in traffic management solutions.  \n \nIt is widely understood that, not only ordinary vehicles are using the road to go \nto one place to another but also different types of emergency response vehicles which \nhelps them respond to the scene quickly. The critical need for rapid response during \nemergencies has also driven significant innovation in traffic management strategies. \nAlmuraykhi and Akhlaq (2019) seamlessly integrates micro -controlled traffic lights, \nGoogle Maps, a dedicated Android application, and the MQTT protocol to prioritize \nemergenc y vehicle movement. By dynamically adjusting traffic signals based on the \nemergency vehicle\'s calculated route, this system aimed to minimize delays and \nensure timely responses to critical situations. This integration of real -time navigation \nand traffic co ntrol represents a vital advancement in public safety infrastructure. This \nsystem allows for preemption of traffic signals, giving emergency vehicles right of way.  \n '),
(48, 63, 27, '27 \n \nMore recent studies have explored the application of advanced technologies \nlike computer vision and artificial intelligence in traffic management. Sequera (2019) \ndeveloped a system using a web camera and fuzzy logic to control traffic lights, \neffectively t aking into account both vehicle and pedestrian traffic. This approach \ndemonstrated the potential of computer vision to capture real -time traffic data, \nincluding pedestrian presence, and the effectiveness of fuzzy logic in handling the \ninherent uncertaintie s and complexities of real -world traffic scenarios. On the other \nhand, Niño et al. (2024) focused on designing a comprehensive disaster and traffic \nmanagement system using image processing from strategically placed CCTV \ncameras, emphasizing rapid software development and rigorous user acceptance \ntesting. Cirsostomo et al. (2024) further advanced this approach by developing a \nsophisticated CNN -based intelligent traffic control system specifically designed for \nemergency vehicle detection and efficient interse ctional traffic flow, demonstrating the \npower of deep learning in analyzing complex video data for enhanced traffic \nmanagement.  \n \nSome studies explore the exciting potential of integrating Language Models \ninto traffic management systems. Masri et al. (2024) convincingly argue that LLMs can \nsignificantly enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of traffic control systems to \nrapidly changing traffic conditions and unexpected events. This integration represents \na significant step towards creating truly adaptive and intelligent systems capable of \nunderstanding and responding to highly complex and dynamic traffic patterns in real -\ntime. F urthermore, Buniel and Tantoy (2024) implemented a practical real -time \nadaptive traffic signal algorithm (RATSA) using readily available Arduino Mega boards \nand ultrasonic sensors, demonstrating the practical application of adaptive control \nstrategies in a  specific urban setting. These advancements point towards a future of \nhighly intelligent and responsive traffic management systems.  \n '),
(49, 63, 28, '28 \n \nOverall, the development of intelligent traffic management has progressed \nremarkably from basic sensor -based systems to sophisticated AI -driven solutions. The \nseamless integration of WSNs, computer vision, fuzzy logic, CNNs, and language \nmodels has enabled the development of increasingly dynamic, responsive, and \nintelligent systems. While foundational sensor -based systems provide the essential \ndata collection infrastructure, advanced AI and machine l earning techniques offer the \npotential for far more intelligent and adaptive control strategies.
